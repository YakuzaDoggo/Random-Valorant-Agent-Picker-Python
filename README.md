# Random-Valorant-Agent-Picker-Python
Similar to my other valorant agent picker, albeit in the Python language instead of C++ (Which you can find [here](https://github.com/YakuzaDoggo/Random-Valorant-Agent-Picker))

## Warning
The release version of this is only EXE, meaning Windows users are only allowed to run it. You could run it on Linux via WINE if you wish, or directly run the python code instead.

## Installation
Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/YakuzaDoggo/Random-Valorant-Agent-Picker/releases), download and run.

## Usage
- Start the program.
- Enter a number of how many players need a random agent.
- The program will do some magic and pick some random agents.
- Chaos ensues.

This program also currently has the added ability to do a reroll instead. In case someone doesn't have a given agent, or wants to be a crybaby about what they were given.
